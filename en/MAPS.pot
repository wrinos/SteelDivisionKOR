Meanwhile, the British VIII. Corps, composed of no less than three armored divisions (Guards, 7th & 11th) attacking together, was to smash through the enemy lines on the Canadians' left flank and size the Bourguebus-Verrières ridge South of Caen to deny the Germans any chance of holding the city any longer.\n\nOn the start line facing Colombelles, East of the Ornes, was the now battle-hardened 3rd Canadian Infantry Division which had stormed Juno Beach over a month before, and to their left the British 11th Armoured Division, spearheading the VIII. Corps’ offensive.\n\nFacing them, holding the German front, was the 16. Luftwaffe-Felddivision, a second-rate unit but supported in its immediate rear by Kampfgruppe von Luck from the veteran 21. Panzerdivision and even the Tigers & brand new Königstigers from schwere Panzer-Abteilung 503 in reserve.\n\nOperations 'Goodwood' & 'Atlantic' were initiated on July 18th, with complete allied air superiority and after a tremendous artillery & air bombardment shattering the 16. Luftwaffe’s positions. Immediately, the Canadians rushed forward and penetrated the first enemy lines, only to meet stiffening resistance as they closed on the Colombelles steelwork itself, due to the timely arrival of von Luck’s Panzergrenadiers.\nIn the more open terrain East of the Canadians, VIII. Corps’ armored divisions had a bad start due to an unreported minefield: forced to wait for the engineers to clear a way, the armored thrust was greatly delayed, giving the German defenders time to recover. As a consequence, the leading 11th Armoured Division had to very soon leave its rare infantry behind to deal with pockets of resistance while the tanks kept advancing unsupported."

It has been in German hands ever since. You shake your head and chuckle to yourself at the thought of anyone ever giving up such an excellent defensive position. The Canadians must be mad to have given up such a place.\n\n Over the last few days both you and the Canadians have been patrolling the area heavily. Your troops have participated in many raids to take prisoners and interrogation has revealed that there will shortly be a big attack in this sector. Coupled with this there have been many reports from observers indicating a build-up of men and material across the front and a gradual increase in air activity. No matter. You are ready. Your men are ready.  The defences are ready. Supplies and ammunition have been distributed. The civilians evacuated to safety.  It will be a hard fight.  It will be a good fight !
